Create a clean, modern, and responsive portfolio website for showcasing your skills and projects. The website should reflect your work as a graphic designer, math teacher, and data scientist. The design should be sleek, professional, and easy to navigate. Here are the key sections to include:  1. Home Page: A hero section with a brief introduction (name, profession, and a tagline). A call-to-action button (e.g., "View My Work" or "Contact Me"). A clean and simple layout that grabs attention and leads visitors to the next sections. 2. About Page: A short bio that summarizes your background, education, skills, and experiences. Personal touch, such as your goals or philosophy as a designer, teacher, and data scientist. 3. Portfolio Section: Showcase your best work as a graphic designer, data scientist, and educator. Each project should have a brief description and images (or links to interactive examples). Include projects like math animations, design work for HIYAMOTO, your teaching materials, and data science projects. 4. Skills Section: List your technical and soft skills (e.g., graphic design, Python, teaching, data visualization). Consider using icons or progress bars to make it visually appealing. 5. Services Section (Optional): Highlight the services you offer, such as graphic design, teaching math online, or data science consulting. Include a contact form for potential clients or students to reach out. 6. Contact Page: Simple contact form with fields for name, email, and message. Links to your social media profiles (LinkedIn, Instagram, GitHub, etc.). 7. Responsive Design: Ensure the website is fully responsive, adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Use a modern CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap to make development faster. Tech Stack: Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap), JavaScript (React or vanilla JS for interactivity). Backend (Optional): If you want a contact form, you can use a backend like Node.js/Express or just a service like Formspree to handle submissions. Visual Design: Clean, minimalist design with lots of white space. Use a color scheme that reflects your style (e.g., monochrome, bold colors for accents). Easy-to-read typography with clear headings and sections.
